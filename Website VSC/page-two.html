<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>At the heart of impulseSave® is technology that enables you 
    to top-up your investments whenever and wherever you want.
    impulseSave® ties in to our goal-first approach to saving,
    because we believe that when you have a reason to save,
    you’re more likely to reach your goal.
    Using our platform, you can track your progress 24/7 online or 
    via a range of apps. If you find a gap between your savings and 
    your goal, you can use impulseSave® to top-up your account and 
    close the gap. 
    With a minimum impulseSave® of just £1, we’ve made investing 
    quick, easy and fun..

<h3>A little goes a long way</h3>
<p> impulseSave® makes it easy for you to regularly top-up your 
    investments with small amounts. You’ll be surprised how small 
    top-ups can add up to large returns over time.
    For example, by replacing something small like a daily cup of
    coffee, you could impulseSave® £2 per day, seven days per 
    week. Over a month, that’s an extra £50 in your investment.
    With a 5% return on your investment, that daily £2 could 
become over £7,800 in a decade. That might be the difference 
between reaching your goal on time or not at all. 
That’s the power of impulseSave® - it all adds up.

<h4>ImpulseSave® takes a bite 
    out of the Big Apple</h4>
<p>September 2014, True Potential was one of just five UK-headquartered companies to showcase new technology at 
    FinovateFall 2014, which highlights the biggest innovations in 
    banking and financial technology.
    Daniel Harrison, Managing Partner of True Potential 
    Investments, had just seven minutes on stage to demonstrate 
    impulseSave® to an audience of over 1,400. 
    Commenting on the event, Harrison said: “impulseSave® was
    built completely in-house by our team of developers based 
    in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, so it was fantastic to take the 
    technology to the US and showcase the top-up technology 
    on an international platform. Our team is extremely proud 
    that we are pushing the boundaries of financial technology 
    from our base in the UK.”
