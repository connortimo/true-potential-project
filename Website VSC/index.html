<h2>What is Impulse Save®?</h2>
<p>In March 2014, we launched our world’s first impulseSave®
investment top-up technology online, and via our iOS and
Android apps. impulseSave® is an exclusive addition to
our client offering, which already includes client sites with
24/7 access to investments.
Now you can top-up your investments on-the-go with as
little as £1. Reaching your goals has never been easier.

<h3>The Big Idea</h3>
<p>Knowing the problems caused by people living longer and
saving less, we challenged ourselves to make investing easier
for everyone.
With payday lenders and short-term loans so accessible,
spending on impulse and getting into debt is worryingly simple.
We needed something that could compete on behalf of savers.
There were apps on the market for savers to top-up their bank
accounts, but nothing for ISAs, General Investment Accounts
and Personal Pensions. We know that cash isn’t the best place for
long-term saving, so we needed to develop a way for people to
add small amounts to their investments. By looking at the types
of technology people were already using, we were able to design
impulseSave® to feel familiar, whilst offering a unique service.
By taking a multi-platform approach, we designed impulseSave®
to fit with people’s lifestyles. Now, savers can top-up their
investments and reach their goals faster, in a way that suits them.

<div class="section-inner">
<h4>Starting With a Goal</h4>
<p>We believe that setting a goal, or a destination, is the most
important and least emphasised part of investing.
A goal gives you a purpose, clear focus and a reason to carry on.
When you know where you’re going and why, you can plan how
best to get there.
Think of it like a journey. Without a destination in mind, you
don’t know how much fuel you’ll need to get there. You’ll be
aimlessly wandering around until you find yourself stranded.
By setting a clear goal for your investment, you’ll always know
where you are and how you are performing. If you’re falling
behind your goal, you have the chance to top-up and get
back on track. Find out how it works HERE.
